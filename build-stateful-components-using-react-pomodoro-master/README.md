# Pomodoro

## Context

Pomodoro is a customizable timer that helps you to concentrate on any task you are working on like writing, studying or coding to boost your productivity. This app is inspired by Pomodoro Technique which is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo.​

The Pomodoro technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.​

As a Front-end developer, you need to design and implement this Pomodoro app using React. The app should be created in different phases where each phase will have some modifications incorporated in it.

## Problem Statement

Create a Pomodoro app to start, pause and end a timer using React class components to achieve the below mentioned user stories.  Refer to the [Pomodoro Mockup](Pomodoro.pdf) for functional and UI requirements.

### User Stories
1. As a User I should be able to start a Pomodoro with default time of 25 Minutes
2. As a User I should be able to see the Current Time Left in Pomodoro Timer.
3. As a User I should be able to stop a ***running*** Pomodoro Timer. Stopping the Pomodoro ***pauses*** the timer. 
4. As a User I should be able to end a ***running*** Pomodoro to its early completion.
5. As a User I should be navigated to the Short Break after every Successful or Early Pomodoro Interval Completion.
6.  As a User I should see the message *Time to Work!* while the Pomodoro Interval tab is active.
7. As a User I should be able to directly navigate to the Short Break Timer.
8. As a User I should be able to start a Short Break Timer with a default time of 5 Minutes.
9. As a User I should be able to see the Current Time Left in Short Break Timer.
10. As a User I should be able to stop a ***running*** Short Break Timer. Stopping the Short Break Timer ***pauses*** the timer. 
11. As a User I should be able to end a ***running*** Short Break Timer to its early completion.
12. As a User I should see the message *Time for Break!* while the Short Break Tab is active.

## Instructions 

1. Download and unzip the boilerplate code. 
2. Run the command `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Open the boilerplate code in VSCode to develop the assignment solution. 
4. The Pomodoro app must be designed using React Class Components. 
5. Edit the `index.html` and `src/App.js` file provided in the boilerplate to complete the solution. 
6. Read the instructions given as comments in `index.html` and `src/App.js` **properly** to develop the solution. 
7. Run the test scripts available under `src/test` by giving `npm run test` command in the terminal to test locally. 
8. Refactor the solution to ensure all test cases are passing.  
9. Zip the solution code with the name same as assignment name. 
10. Upload the zipped solution for submission.
