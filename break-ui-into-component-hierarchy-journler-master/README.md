# Break UI Into Component Hierarchy - Journler

## Context

Join millions of Journler users and create a healthier, happier mind. Journler helps increase positive energy and minimize the impact of negative mood swings.​

It facilitates users to be more grateful and have a calmer mind by building healthy thinking through journaling.

As a Front-end developer, you are expected to create the Journler app where the application is decomposed to multiple components using component-based design approach.

## Problem Statement

Create a Journler app using `create-react-app` tool. The functionality listed in the following user stories must be achieved by dividing the app into multiple reusable components. Refer to the [Journler Mockup](Journaler.pdf) for functional and UI requirements. 

Following are the user stories to be developed:​​

1. As a User, post login, I should be able to add a new Journal item with details such as my mood (excited, happy, sad, angry, surprised), journal date, title, and text.​
2. As a User, post login, I should be able to cancel the addition of a new Journal item.​
3. As a User, post login, I should be able to view existing Journal items.​
4. As a User, post login, I should be able to view aggregated count for each of the moods.​
5. As a User, post login, I should be able to edit selected Journal items.​
6. As a User, post login, I should be able to delete selected Journal items.​
7. As a User, post login, I should be able to cancel the editing of the selected Journal item.​

### Instructions

1. Download and unzip the boilerplate code.  
2. Run the command `npm install` to install the dependencies. 
3. Open the boilerplate code in VSCode to develop the assignment solution.  
4. The Journler application has been created using the `create-react-app` tool.  
5. Edit App, JournalCollection, JournalEditor, JournalViewer and MoodStats components which are placed inside the `src` folder.  
6. Mood Smileys used in the application are available by adding the following link:`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://pro.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.13.0/css/all.css">`  
7. Run the test scripts available under `src/test` by giving the `npm run test` command in the terminal to test locally. 
8. Refactor the solution to ensure all test cases are passing.
9. Zip the solution code with the name same as the assignment name.  
10. Upload the zipped solution for submission.
